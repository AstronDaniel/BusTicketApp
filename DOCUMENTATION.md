- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (a NoSQL cloud database)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (for secure user login)
- **Bluetooth Printing:** react-native-ble-plx (for Bluetooth communication)
- **State Management:** React Context API (for managing app state)
- **UI Components:** Native Base & Custom Components (for user interface design)
